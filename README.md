# Nani

Simple HTTPoison wrapper which provides sensible defaults and some additional
processing (like parsing JSON, CSV and TSV into maps) - it can be used in all
kinds of API clients.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `nani` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:nani, "~> 0.1"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/nani](https://hexdocs.pm/nani).
